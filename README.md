# Brickbox - the simple LEGO wishlist app!

This React application allows users to search for LEGO sets and add them to a wishlist. Users can then view store pages for the LEGO sets in their wishlist. The app is built with Vite, TypeScript, and SCSS. [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/home/) was used to fetch data about LEGO sets. Basic build deployed [here](https://philip-avdey-brickbox.netlify.app/).
